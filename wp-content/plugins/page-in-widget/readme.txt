A tiny plugin that displays a page content in a widget.

== Description ==

The Page in Widget widget lets you display a page content inside a widget. This way you have more control how the content is displayed, and it's much easier than hacking your own HTML.

The output is filtered through the_content-filter which means that paragraph tags are added, just as any other post or page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the zipfile to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Extract and remove it
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Drag the new widget to desired sidebar, choose a title for the widget and select the appropriate page.
