  <h2 style="font-size:24px;">And the answer is...</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:13px; line-height:20px;">As a result of Seelig's departure, <strong>the company held a contest in 1925 to develop a new name, the result of which was Safeway.</strong> The original slogan was "an admonition and an invitation" to "Drive the Safeway; Buy the Safeway." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeway_Inc.#cite_note-7">[8]</a> <font style="text-decoration:underline">The point of the name was that the grocery operated on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_and_carry_%28sales%29">cash-and-carry</a> basis; it did not offer credit, as had been traditional for grocers. It was the "safe way" to buy because a family could not get into debt via its grocery bill (as many families did, especially during the Great Depression)</font>.
